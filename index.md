The DIGImend project aims at improving Linux support for generic graphics
tablets.

These include ones designed and sold by Huion, KYE, UC-Logic and Waltop,
rebranded and sold by Aiptek, Genius, Monoprice, Princeton, Trust, and many
others. Essentially, any USB-connected tablets not produced by Wacom. For the
latter see [The Linux Wacom Project](http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/).

We work to provide kernel drivers, kernel and userspace driver fixes,
accompanying development, testing and end-user tools, documentation and
HOWTOs.
