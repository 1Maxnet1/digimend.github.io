title: Drivers

We strive to submit all drivers and fixes to upstream projects, including the
Linux kernel, xf86-input-evdev and xf86-input-wacom. However, to make it
easier to develop and test new kernel drivers, and to let people running older
kernels use their new tablets, we're maintainig an out-of-tree driver package:
[digimend-kernel-drivers][1]. The driver package works on v3.5 and later
kernels and supports a variety of tablets listed in its [README.md][2].
