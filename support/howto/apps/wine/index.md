title: Tablet setup in Wine
---
Wine lets you run Windows software on other operating systems. With
Wine, you can install and run these applications just like you would in
Windows.\<sup\>[1]\</sup\>

In this tutorial you can learn how to setup your tablet, which uses the
evdev driver, working in this software.

Wine 1.5
========

The Wine team started to work on the 1.5 develpment release in March
2012. This version is the latest development version wich is currently
in active development.

Tablet setup
------------

This sofware is not compatible with the evdev driver, so the pen's
pressure will not affect anything.

If you were brave enough to have made Wine evdev compatible by patching
and compiling the source code yourself, you will not need to do any
device configuration. Your pen should just work in Wine.

More information
================

You can find more information about Wine on the [official website of the
software](http://www.winehq.org/).
