Blender is one of the most popular Open Source 3D graphics applications
in the world. Aimed at media professionals and artists world-wide,
Blender can be used to create 3D visualizations such as stills or
broadcast and cinema quality videos. The incorporation of a real-time 3D
engine allows for the creation of 3D interactive content for stand-alone
playback.\<sup\>[1]\</sup\>

In this tutorial you can learn how to setup your tablet, which uses the
evdev driver, working in this software.

Blender 2.66 and above
======================

This version was released on February 21, 2013.

Tablet setup
------------

Blender is compatible with the evdev driver. There's no need to do any
device configuration. Your pen should just work in Blender.

Blender 2.65 and below
======================

Blender versions 2.65 and below are not compatible with the evdev
driver, so the pen's pressure will not affect anything.

More information
================

You can find more information about Blender on the [official website of
the software](http://www.blender.org/).
