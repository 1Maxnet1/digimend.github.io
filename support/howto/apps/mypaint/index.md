In this tutorial you can learn how to setup your tablet, which uses the
evdev driver, working in this software.

default version in most Linux distributions.

Tablet setup
------------

In order to set up your device choose *MyPaint\>Help\>Debug\>GTK input
device dialog* from the menu. On the **Input** dialogue select your
device and set the *Mode* to *Screen*. The following image illustrates

This version has been released on the 2nd of November 2010. This was the
default version of MyPaint in earlier Linux distributions, like Ubuntu
